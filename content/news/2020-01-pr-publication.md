# W3C Proposed Recommendations for WoT Thing Description and WoT Architecture
### 30 January 2020


[Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/PR-wot-thing-description-20200130/): This document describes a formal model and common representation for a Web of Things Thing Description. A Thing Description describes the metadata and interfaces of Things, where a Thing is an abstraction of a physical entity that provides interactions to and participates in the Web of Things.

[Web of Things (WoT) Architecture](https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/PR-wot-architecture-20200130/): This document describes the abstract architecture for the W3C Web of Things, which consists of three initial building blocks, i.e., (1) WoT Thing Description, (2) WoT Scripting API and (3) WoT Binding Templates.
